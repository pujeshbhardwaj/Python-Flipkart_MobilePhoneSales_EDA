Project Title: Flipkart Mobile Data Analysis

This project focuses on conducting an exploratory data analysis of Flipkart Mobile Phones Sales Data. The dataset contains detailed information about various mobile brands, including brand, model, color, memory, storage, rating, selling price, and original price. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into different brands and their price ranges, identify the most popular brand, and determine the most popular model within each brand.

Key Findings:

Samsung, Apple, and Oppo are the brands with relatively higher ratings and have price ranges mostly between 15,000 to 30,000 INR.
The market is saturated with lower to mid-range cost phones, mostly priced below 25,000 INR.
Samsung leads in the number of phones sold, followed by Apple and Realme.
Apple consistently receives high ratings, mostly between 4.5 to 5.
Most phones of Google Pixel and Apple are in the 50,000 to 75,000 INR price range.
Samsung has the highest market share, followed by Apple and Realme.
In this exploratory analysis, we visualized various aspects of the data, such as brand-wise pricing, rating trends, and market share. We also identified the highest and lowest sold models and their counts.

Future Work:
This analysis could be extended to explore relationships between brands, colors, memory, storage, and ratings. Predictive analysis could be conducted to estimate future sales trends based on historical data. Additionally, deeper insights can be gained by incorporating external data sources, such as customer reviews and feedback, to understand customer preferences and sentiment towards different mobile brands and models.
